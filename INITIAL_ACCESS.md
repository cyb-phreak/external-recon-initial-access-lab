## Telnet Initial Access Validation
Initial access validation was performed to determine whether the exposed Telnet service presents a realistic authentication attack surface. Actions were intentionally limited to avoid unauthorized access beyond validating exposure.

### Telnet Exposure Assessment
A connection to the Telnet service was successfully established, and an interactive login prompt was presented. This confirms that the service is accessible from the network and accepts authentication attempts over an unencrypted channel.

Based on this validation, the Telnet service was confirmed to present a realistic initial access vector. Further authentication testing could be justified in a controlled engagement scenario.
