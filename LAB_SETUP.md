## Attacker VM Baseline
The Kali Linux attacker VM was successfully deployed and accessed using a standard user account. System stability and network interface availability were verified prior to any engagement activity.

## Network Isolation
The attacker VM was connected to a host-only VirtualBox network to ensure all activity remained within the authorized lab environment and could not interact with external systems.
