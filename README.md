# External Reconnaissance & Initial Access (Foundational Lab)

## Overview
This repository documents a foundational cybersecurity lab project focused on understanding how attackers perform external reconnaissance and achieve initial access. The project is conducted entirely in a controlled virtual lab environment using intentionally vulnerable machines.

The goal is to better understand how exposed services and configurations can be discovered and why this matters in defensive security.

## Objectices
- Simulate external roconnaissance from an attacker's perspective
- Identify exposed services and attack surface
- Demonstrate one realistic initial access technique
- Analyze security gaps and recommend mitigations

## Environment
- Host OS: Linux Mint
- Virtualization: VirtualBox
- Attacker: Kali Linux VM
- Targets: Metasploitable2
- Network: Host-only network

## Disclaimer
All activities were conducted in a controlled lab environment. No unauthorized systems or real networks were tested.
