# External Reconnaissance & Initial Access (Foundational Lab)

## Overview
This project documents a foundational cybersecurity lab focused on understanding how attackers perform external reconnaissance and achieve initial access. The project is conducted entirely in a controlled virtual lab environment using intentionally vulnerable machines.
The focus is on understanding attacker methodology, decision making, and identifying defendive controls that could detect or prevent these actions

## Objectices
- Simulate external roconnaissance from an attacker's perspective
- Identify exposed services and attack surface
- Demonstrate one realistic initial access vector
- Analyze security gaps and recommend mitigations

## Environment
- Host OS: Linux Mint
- Virtualization: VirtualBox
- Attacker: Kali Linux VM
- Targets: Metasploitable2
- Network: Host-only network

## Disclaimer
All activities were conducted in a controlled lab environment. No unauthorized systems or real networks were tested.
